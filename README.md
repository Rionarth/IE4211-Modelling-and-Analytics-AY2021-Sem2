In this project, you need to find patterns from Data-train.csv and predict the sales for Data-test.csv. The performance of the prediction would be judged by the mean square error. The smaller the error is, the better your prediction is.
  
  Moreover, we assume that the company need to make the inventory decision every day. The product costs 12 dollars to purchase and can be sold at the price of 20 dollars. If the product could not be sold by the end of the day, the firm can salvage the product (for instance quick sell to a vendor) at the price 8 dollars. Given this situation, you need to make the inventory decision for each day. We would then calculate the profit induced by your inventory decisions.
  
  Note that in reality, the firm can stock the inventory to the next period. To solve this more realistic setting, one has to use the dynamic programming method, which is out of the scope of this course. Our setting is a reasonable simplification of the reality that can capture some insights into the problem.
